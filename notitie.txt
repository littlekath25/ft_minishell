{{ echo — Prints text to the terminal window }}
echo prints text to the terminal window and is typically used in shell scripts and batch files 
to output status text to the screen or a computer file. Echo is also particularly useful for 
showing the values of environmental variables, which tell the shell how to behave as a user 
works at the command line or in scripts.

option n: -n option can be used to remove the '\n' (newline character) from the output. 
By default, echo includes '\n' at the end of every string it outputs. In the example above, 
since the newline character at the end of the output is omitted, the terminal prompts the 
user for input in the same line as the output.

{{ cd — Change directory }}
cd will change the directory you’re in so that you can get info, manipulate, read, etc. 
the different files and directories in your system.

{{ pwd — Print working directory }}
pwd is used to print the current directory you’re in. As an example, if you have multiple
terminals going and you need to remember the exact directory you’re working within, 
then pwd will tell you.

{{ export }}
export command is used to export a variable or function to the environment 
of all the child processes running in the current shell.

{{ unset }}
Use unset command to delete the variables during program execution. 
It can remove both functions and shell variables.

{{ env }}
The env command can be used to alter the environment variable before executing a command or print 
the environment. The changes to the environment are not persisted in the current shell environment.

{{ exit }}
Exit the bash shell or shell script with a status of N.
